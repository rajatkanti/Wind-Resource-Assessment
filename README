Start with gitWRAExample.m. 
It uses functions for the following tasks. 
gitWRAio.xlsx is the output file for this program. Make sure the path provided in the code is changed to appropriate location based on your system path. 
The code can be use to perform 
\item Weibull distribution simulation.
\item Extrapolation using power law. 
\item Frequency distribution. 
\item Parameter estimation using traditional methods.
Use the choices judiciously for your requirement. 

Power, Energy and Turbine Performance Index:
gitWRApowerEn.m is used for computing power and energy output. 
gitPlotTPI.m is used for plotting Turbine Performance Index
gitWindRose.m plots wind rose diagram
